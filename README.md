This project helps you to download a large amount of __ordered__ PDF-files from a remote server, downloads, joins and optimizes them.

You'll need a list of the links to the PDF files comprising your book. If you're using Google Chrome, you might want to use [Link Klippr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/link-klipper-extract-all/fahollcgofmpnehocdgofnhkkchiekoo).
Configure it to use "TXT" as output format, set "Multiple Extensions" to "pdf" and activate the option.

After that, you're good to go.
